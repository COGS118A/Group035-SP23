    "You will design and execute a machine learning project. There are a few constraints on the nature of the allowed project. \n",
    "- The problem addressed will not be a \"toy problem\" or \"common training students problem\" like mtcars, iris, palmer penguins etc.\n",
    "- The dataset will have >1k observations and >5 variables. I'd prefer more like >10k observations and >10 variables. A general rule is that if you have >100x more observations than variables, your solution will likely generalize a lot better. The goal of training a supervised machine learning model is to learn the underlying pattern in a dataset in order to generalize well to unseen data, so choosing a large dataset is very important.\n",

    "- The project will include a model selection and/or feature selection component where you will be looking for the best setup to maximize the performance of your ML system.\n",

    "# Abstract \n",
    "Our goal is to develop an effective email spam detection system. We will be using a dataset consisting of labeled emails, where each email is classified as either spam or non-spam. The data represents various features extracted from the emails, such as the presence of certain keywords, email header information, and textual content. We will employ machine learning algorithms to train a model on this labeled data to accurately classify incoming emails as spam or non-spam. The performance of the system will be measured by evaluating its ability to correctly classify a new set of emails, using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Our objective is to achieve high accuracy and minimize false positives (legitimate emails classified as spam) and false negatives (spam emails classified as legitimate), ensuring an efficient and reliable spam detection system."

    "\n",
    "The field of email spam detection has been extensively researched, with significant prior work paving the way for advancements in this area. Various techniques and approaches have been explored to tackle the problem of email classification, aiming to accurately distinguish between spam and non-spam emails.\n",
    "\n",
    "Researchers have employed machine learning algorithms, such as support vector machines (SVMs), naive Bayes classifiers, and ensemble methods, to build effective spam detection models<a name=\"solanki\"></a>[<sup>[1]</sup>](#solanki)<a name=\"dada\"></a>[<sup>[2]</sup>](#dada). These models utilize features extracted from email content, such as keyword presence, textual analysis, and email header information, to make predictions on the classification of incoming emails.\n",
    "\n",
    "Feature engineering has been a crucial aspect of this research, as it involves selecting and extracting relevant features that contribute to the identification of spam emails<a name=\"dada\"></a>[<sup>[2]</sup>](#dada). Additionally, researchers have explored the use of natural language processing techniques to analyze the text of emails, including techniques like text tokenization, stemming, and TF-IDF weighting<a name=\"sahami\"></a>[<sup>[3]</sup>](#sahami)<a name=\"yang\"></a>[<sup>[4]</sup>](#yang)."
